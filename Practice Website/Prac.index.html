                        <p>
                        I was born in New Jersey and have always been passionate about creativity and technology. 
                        I enjoy music, movies, playing guitar, video games, and exploring new ways to express myself. 
                        My love for technology began as a kid playing God of War and grew stronger through my time in the Army, 
                        where I served as an IT Specialist. From building my first PC to developing my first video game, 
                        technology has been a constant source of inspiration and purpose in my life.

                    <p>This is a portfolio website that i wanted to make to showcase my work, my life and skills! I'm adding a snippet of my life, projects that I've made, skills that I have learned, my certification, and my information!</p>

                    <h3>Project 2: Blizzard Game</h3>
                    <p>Blizzard is a text-based adventure game I created using Python. Players explore a frozen world, make choices that affect the story, and solve challenges along the way. This project helped me practice core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions while also letting me flex my creativity in storytelling and game design.</p>

                    <h3>Project 3: Coffee Website</h3>
                    <p>The Coffee Website is a responsive site I built to practice semantic HTML and CSS layout techniques. It features sections for different coffee types, brewing methods, and a simple contact form. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of accessibility, responsive design, and clean code structure while creating something visually appealing and practical.</p>
